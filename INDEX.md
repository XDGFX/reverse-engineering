# reverse-engineering
Welcome to my Reverse Engineering module supplemental info homepage! Here I have provided some extra information I would have liked to include in the poster submissions but couldn't, sorted into the relevant submission sections.

#### [User Experience](/user-experience.md)
#### [Assembly & Materials](/assembly.md)
#### [Component Role & Function](/component.md)
#### [Manufacturing & Costs](/manufacturing.md)


### Not of relevance to the course, but might be interesting
- [Aesthetic Inspiration](https://www.behance.net/gallery/63848577/VOYAGER-III?tracking_source=search%7Cposter%20product)
- [How did I make this webpage with basically no effort?](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/)
- [Original poster files](https://github.com/XDGFX/reverse-engineering/tree/master/master-files). Made in Photoshop... definitely not the right tool for the job but it's what I'm most familiar with.
