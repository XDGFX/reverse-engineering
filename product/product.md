# The Product

We found on several occasions that the manual was not accurate to other information sources, or the product itself. The physical manual was printed in black and white, yet the online PDF had lots of useful colour highlighted diagrams (cost saving measures...).

Apart from the figures listed in the poster, another main discrepancy was the Turbo Tool cleaning instructions; the manual suggests there is some sort of collar to be removed in order to open the component for cleaning. In reality, the collar is held by two Phillips head screws.
