# Styling

### Branding
Branding of the product and packaging is a key area where users will identify and understand a product. Before tech-specs, this is how one product is differentiated from another.

- Claims, brags, 2M SOLD, reminding you the product is good
- VAX in large font, strong product image

### Contact Points
Contact points are where the user will be interacting with the product for extended periods of time. These are the areas that define a premium product, through feel and durability.

**Rubber vs Injection moulded plastic**
- 40 - 90 duro hardness
- Abrasion resistance
- Soft feel

**Buttons**
- Highlight colour to indicate use
- Hard plastic, cheap and hard wearing

### Visual pointers
Visual pointers on the product itself serve as operational hints, allowing for easier understanding and use.

- Several text hints, easy to understand if english
- Some symbols, power, arrows for movement
